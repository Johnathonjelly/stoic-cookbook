              On the left are a list of recipes I've done.
          </span> These recipes are not only about food. These are recipes for a healthy <i>mind</i>
          These technqiues are only suggestions to developing a healthy relationship with your own mind.
          It is important to understand that these are not a typical fix all--do it once and your done type of
          thing. Some of what is mention is to be practiced and studied much like you would anything else.
          There is no magical pill for weight loss just as there is no magic pill for a health mindset. I invite
          you to read my take on the technqiues and for you to consider working these techniques into your
          own routine.
