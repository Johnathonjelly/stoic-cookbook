              <h2>Why Create This Site?</h2>
              <p>Great question! The reason for this website is to catalog my own thoughts on personal
              developement. </p>
              <br>
              <h2>What is stoicism?</h2>
              <p>To be a stoic does not mean to throw all emotion away. Here is a quick paragraph on
              stoicism:<br>
            <blockquote cite="http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_stoicism.html">Stoicism is an ancient Greek
              philosophy (developed by Zeno of Citium around 300 B.C. as a refinement of Cynicism)
              which teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive
              emotions. It does not seek to extinguish emotions competely, but rather seeks to transform them by a
               resolute Asceticism
              (a voluntary abstinence from worldly pleasures), which enables a person to develop clear judgment,
              inner calm and freedom from suffering (which it considers the ultimate goal).
            </blockquote><br><small>That lovely description was from this website
