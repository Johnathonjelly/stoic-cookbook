            <h3>What kind of books are we talking here?</h3>
            <p>I like to read all kinds of books. I'd like to share some of what I've learned
            and I invite you to read the ones that intrigue you.  <span class="stand-out">
              On the left are a list of book reviews I've done.
          </span> There is going to be some focus on self development books. There will be ethics invovled.
           Don't let the title they have scare you though. A lot of these books can be extremely powerful if you
      respect the content, internalize what it has to say, and make it your own(and practice the methods). </p>
      <p>Self Development books won't be all I will be looking at. I would also like the share with you my thoughts
      on non-fiction books. The likes of Stienbeck, Orwell, and Lovecraft will grace these pages, just
    to name a few. </p>
